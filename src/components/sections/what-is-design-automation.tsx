              What is design automation?
            </h2>

              Design automation embeds an engineer’s rules, parameters, and
              decision logic into software so that 3D models, drawings, BOMs,
              and even cost estimates spring automatically from a handful of
              inputs rather than hours of manual work. By housing all
              dimensions, formulas, and option-dependent features in a master
              template, the system scales parts, adds or suppresses components,
              renames files, fills out BOMs, and runs clearance or cost checks
              in seconds—transforming what was once time-consuming “click
              work” for design engineers and draughtspersons into a
              push-button routine. The result is a triple win: lead times and
              labor costs plummet, error-prone steps vanish, and skilled staff
              are freed to focus on higher-value tasks like concept
              development, simulation, or client collaboration, turning
              accuracy from a hope into a guarantee while capturing
              institutional know-how for every future variant.
